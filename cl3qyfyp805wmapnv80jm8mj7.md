## My Experience in KubeCon | CloudNativeCon-  2022

Hello, today I will tell you about my experience in KubeCon | Cloud-Native 2022. I have attended KubeCon virtually. As I am a student, I got a free virtual pass by doing some sort of quick survey. I was so excited, I can even feel that excitement till today while writing this. 

# My Experience

This event started on the 16th of May and ended on the 20th of May. But the most unfortunate thing among all of these is that I could only attend the program on 16th and 17th of May(due to college exams). But I can surely tell you that within these two days whatever I have learned is unforeseen.

So, on the first day, there was a silly confusion in the login section. You have to log in with your registered email ID and the password will be your Registration/confirmation ID, I have written my email password. LOL(with shame).

After entering, there was a warm welcome from around the world. Really nice video! Saiyam was looking smart with his Lil ðŸ˜Ž, Kunal was looking damn cuteðŸ˜Š and everyone was so excited about this event.

### Sessions 

What I have seen is, that there are tons of events out there and some of them are having time collisions, 
So I decided to make some sort of session schedule that I will follow throughout the day.

# Events that I loved most

As you can see from the above picture I joined so many events within two days, basically all events shared their tools, how to get started, and showed hands-on demos. So I will share the best two events that I loved and felt grateful to join.

## Kasten K10 (V5.0)

Kasten is basically a data management platform, it provides enterprise operations teams an easy-to-use, scalable and secure system for backup/restore, disaster recovery, and application mobility of Kubernetes applications.

Then they showed the installation part, then talked about Detecting Ransomware Attacks, Kubernetes-Native RBAC, and Data Protection Policy Guardrails. 

As it was a 30mins speech, this much was covered. But I was curious  about some concepts so I 
went to their website and explored some of the documentation. 

> So if you want to learn more about Kasten K10, just head over to their website and join their slack or discord community and ask anything.

So after that day, I received a mail from Kasten. It was an invitation for an open conversation with the Kasten team and if anyone has any doubt feel free to ask. So I attended that conversion at 7:00 pm IST. It stated around 6:00 pm, I was late because I had my college. I saw there was a kind of icebreaking session (which was the best thing for me to interact with). So it was like, you have to open your camera and have to tell your journey about KubeCon, what events did you attend this far?  how did you know about Kasten? and do you have any questions related to Kasten?. While you are telling them your story, a super talented guy name Rob will draw your custom caricature.

So I did the same, asked a couple of questions like- Is there any way to do Open-Source projects? also asked, are there any events or contests coming up, where folks can contribute their learnings? 
All were answered very well by Andrei Dicher. And thanks to Rob Stolt for drawing my Caricature.

## CloudNative Journey At Apple

In this event, we have a conversation about Mesos, the history of Mesos, Compute Management on Kubernetes.

Mesos-
- Multiple scheduling framework
- Supported a variety of services
- Bottleneck for scale + responsibility delegation

> As Kubernetes was an obvious winner as an orchestrator 
> So what happens if Kubernetes +  Cloud Native

- Pluggability 
- Extensibility
- Ecosystem 
- Meets demands of a diverse user base

Apple team has a goal to make the majority of apple workloads run on Kubernetes 
So there are some platform users to maintain end-user focus while building the platform.
5 users are there- 
- 1st users- Users on java, python, and go developers who want to test and run their applications in the containers
- 2nd users- Application SRE teams who focus is on advanced deployment workflows for their teams
- 3rd users- Hardware QA engineers who try new things and explore creative solutions using cloud
- 4th users- Machine learning/batch workload engineer.
- 5th users- Finance (a big part of placement decisions and capacity planning.)

> Reduce the platform complexity for developers and operators. At the same time, want to maintain high-security standards and resource utilization.

That's all I have to share more precisely. Thankyou to KubeCon for  giving me this wonderful experience
